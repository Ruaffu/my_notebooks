Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney; 1881–1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.[18] Julius and Ethel married on 1 Oct 1907 at Batholomew's church on Clyde Road, in Dublin.[19]\n",
      "Julius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale,[20] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[21][22] later the Colonnade Hotel.[16][23] Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).[24]\n",

At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.[26] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.[27]\n",
      "Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.[28] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.[29]\n",

      "Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938,\n",
      "After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers[13] and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[1] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s\n",
      "Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954,\n",
      "Following a public campaign in 2009, the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way [Turing] was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. The term \"Alan Turing law\" is now used informally to refer to a 2017 \n",
      "Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England £50 note, which was released on 23 June 2021, to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 \n",

      "Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).[31] In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School,[32] a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 \n",
      "Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: \"I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school\".[34] Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928,\n",
      "At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930),[36] who has been described as Turing's \"first love\". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930,\n",
      "Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthday.[41] A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (13 February 1933)\n",
      "After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved a version of the central limit theorem.[46] Unknown to Turing, this version of the theorem had already been proven, in 1922,\n",
      "In 1936, Turing published his paper \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\".[50] It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December.[51] In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928.\n",
      " King's College, Cambridge, where Turing was an undergraduate in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935.\n",
      "From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University,[4] in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.[56] In June 1938,\n",
      "When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 \n",
      "From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.[65] Soon after the July 1939 meeting near Warsaw at which the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages, Turing and Knox developed a broader solution.[66] The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they in fact did in May 1940.\n",
      " Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park. Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940,\n",
      "On 4 September 1939,\n",
      "By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography[70] and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions,[71] which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012,\n",
      "While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to London when he was needed for meetings,[78] and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.[79][80] Turing tried out for the 1948 \n",
      "At the end of the war, a memo was sent to all those who had worked at Bletchley Park, reminding them that the code of silence dictated by the Official Secrets Act did not end with the war but would continue indefinitely.[69] Thus, even though Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1946 \n",
      " A working replica of a bombe now at The National Museum of Computing on Bletchley ParkThe bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 1019 states, or 1022 \n",
      "The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.\n",
      "By late 1941,\n",
      "Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma \"because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself\".[98] In December 1939,\n",
      "Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942[\n",
      "During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.[104] He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943.\n",
      "In July 1942,\n",
      "Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,[116] while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946,\n",
      "Although ACE was a feasible design, the effect of the Official Secrets Act surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park made it impossible for Turing to explain the basis of his analysis of how a computer installation involving human operators would work.[119] This led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.[120] While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950,\n",
      "According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse.[122] It took place in Göttingen in 1947.\n",
      "In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.[123] During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,[124] and in \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (Mind, October 1950)\n",
      "In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp.[126] In 1952,\n",
      "When Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction–diffusion system, could account for \"the main phenomena of morphogenesis\".[131] He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951,\n",
      "Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.[133] One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.[134][135][136] Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of \"feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.\"[137] In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.[138] Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A. M. Turing was published in 1992.\n",
      "In 1941,\n",
      "In January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[141] and both men were charged with \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.\n",
      "Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[143] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.\n",
      "Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952,\n",
      "In the 1940s, Turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a German invasion. In order to protect it, he bought two silver bars weighing 3,200 oz (90 kg) and worth £250 (in 2022,\n",
      "On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow,[153] Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.[154] When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[155] it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide.[145] Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew\".[156] Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954,\n",
      "It has been suggested that Turing's belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood.[158] As a youth, Turing had been told by a fortune-teller that he would be a genius. In mid-May 1954,\n",
      "In August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual.[163][164] The petition received more than 30,000 signatures.[165][166] The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 \n",
      "In December 2011,\n",
      "We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of \"gross indecency\". In 1952,\n",
      "John Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–\n",
      "On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.\n",
      "At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014,[192] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[193] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for \"gross indecency\", with immediate effect.[194] Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be \"remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort\" and not for his later criminal conviction.[171][195] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.\n",
      "In September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an \"Alan Turing law\".[199][200] The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017,\n",
      "Turing was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946.[88] He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951.\n",
      "Turing has been honoured in various ways in Manchester, the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the A6010 road (the Manchester city intermediate ring road) was named \"Alan Turing Way\". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park, between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal Street. The memorial statue depicts the \"father of computer science\" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple.
